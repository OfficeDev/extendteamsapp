### Outlook add-in

To run outlook add-in you need a windows desktop app with Beta channel.
You'll need to choose the debug configuration `Outlook Desktop (Edge Chromium)` before selecting F5. Be sure you choose the configuration with "Desktop" in the name and _not_ just "Outlook"
This will sideload the add-in to Outlook.

The first time you run this add-in, you will get two prompts that need to be answered:

1. You will be prompted in the VS Code Terminal window:
"Allow localhost loopback for Microsoft Edge WebView? (Y/n)"
You will need to accept this for the add-in/debugging to work
2. There will be a Windows pop-up asking if you want to install a certificate into your machine's certificate store. You will need to accept this in order to proceed. Note:
Sometimes the window prompting this pops-up behind other windows. You may need to keep an keen eye out for it when you're running this for the first time.

To test:

Compose a new meeting and on the top ribbon select the "Northwind categories" add in, which will open a taskpane.
Select a category from the form (one or more categories) and apply to the mail. You will see colour coded labels on the top of the meeting.
Don't select `Northwind suppliers: sales` from the list. Compose email with body having "sales" in text.
Try to send the meeting request after filling the rest (Title, To, lLocation etc) of the form.
You will get a dialog prompt to add the `Northwind suppliers: sales`to the meeting before sending.
